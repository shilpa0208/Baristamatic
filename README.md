Simulation of Coffee Dispensary Machine

Given a set of Ingredients with their cost per unit, the Menu for the dispensary machine, the drink name with the volume of ingrements required, the inventory, the machine has to dispense based on the user entered value (which can range from 1-6 or q/Q for Quit or r/R for restocking the machine).

The machine has to validate the user input and show invalid input response for the wrong values and Out of Stock for the drinks which do not have suffcient ingredients in stock. The True and False values in the menu show if the particular drink is available or not at that given point of time.Also, the cost of each drink is diisplayed in the Menu.

The inventory shows the ingredients with the volume of each at that given point of time.
